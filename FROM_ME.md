I am learning arm assembly now, as I have to write essentialis functions.
I need to know Linux software interrupts also(Android uses Linux kernel).
A am not going to use any libs specific to Android/other UNIX-like systems. It should work on both.
I must use as few system specific folders as possible(eg /system/bin on Android is neccesary, but some not).

In future I may need helpe with other assemblers(x86, MIPS).
